Problem Statement
-----------------

In team-based tournament sports, often individual contributions are
overshadowed by the binary end result: win or lose.  This
winner-takes-all mentality may unfairly pair players in later stages
of the tournament based on the team's score rather than their own in
early stages.


Background
----------

Generally, new team based competitions have been managed
electronically using archaic methods.  The winning team advances and
the losing team is defeated.  In the real world there are many
examples of individual review (as in football) and handicaps (as in
golf).  Our goal is to create software that allows teams to compete
and review their peers to more accurately represent modern team
competitions.  Our domain is online competition management and
e-sports.  The targeted audience is defined on two levels, on a broad
level it is for any individual wishing to manage a competitive event,
on a niche level it is for individuals looking to manage and
participate in team competitions (like League of Legends).

TODO - Luke write about existing software.
