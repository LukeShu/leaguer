Riot API

The Riot API allowed us to pull information from the Riot servers for League of Legends 
Tournaments.  For sprint 2, we were able to pull the information, but not very efficiently.
We ran into an issue where we were making too many pull requests for our Riot developer key
which would gave us some issues.  

Anti-Spam

For now, the only anti-spam protection that we have is a captcha at the user creation page.
Our hopes is to implement an email verification system in order to help further protect
Project Leaguer from spam.
