# User Stories

1) As an administrator, I would like to install and boot my own server.
    - Alternately: As a developer, I would like a demo/testing server,
      with a basic Rails setup.
2) As a host/player, I would like to register and have an account.
    - For this task, we will be creating the user registration and log
      in capabilities for Leaguer.
3) As a host, I would like to start a tournamnet.
    - For this task, we will be creating a base tournament system for a
      host to run.
4) As a host/player, I would like to enter scores for players.
    - For sprint own, the scores will be entered by hand.
5) As an administrator, I want to specify how users become hosts.
6) As a user I would like to see the progress of the tournament in my
   browser.
7) As a user, I would like a presentable homepage.
    - For this task, we will be creating a Leaguer homepage and ensure that it
      is pleasing to the eye and easy to navigate.


# Tasks

The "size" is using the modified Fibonacci scale.  A '1' is expected
to take less than an hour.  A '3' is expected to take 3-6 hours.  A
'5' should take the better part of a day or two.  An 8 should take
several days.
