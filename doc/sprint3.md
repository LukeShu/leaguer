# User Stories

1) As a user, I would like my League of Legends user and match information to be 
  obtained automatically; with no input from myself.

2) As an user, I would like Project Leaguer to look more polished and complete.

3) As an admin, I would like to have email verification in order to prevent spam.

4) As a host, I would like to have more base tournament settings (e.g. Round
  Robin team pairings).

5) As a user, I would like better peer evaluations for the pussies that can't rank 
  their teammates.

6) As an admin, I would like to send alerts to users.

7) As a user, I would like to be able to send private messages.


#Tasks

The "size" is using the modified Fibonacci scale.  A '1' is expected
to take less than an hour.  A '3' is expected to take 3-6 hours.  A
'5' should take the better part of a day or two.  An 8 should take
several days.
