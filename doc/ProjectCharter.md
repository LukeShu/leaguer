1. In team-based tournament sports, often individual contributions are
   overshadowed by the binary end result: win or lose.  This
   winner-takes-all mentality may unfairly pair players in later
   stages of the tournament based on the team's score rather than
   their own in early stages.

2. Project Objectives:
  * To address issues of fairness in tournament orchestration and
  * To create a general-purpose open source solution for organizing
    team-based tournaments where individual performance matters
    * by implementing an out-of-the-box open source server software
    * capable of managing pairings, scoring, and statistics for a
      variety of applicable game types
    * accessable via an intuitive web interface.

3. Stakeholders - the development team, testers, and a future community of users.

4. A Project Leaguer server provides the user with everything needed
   to run a tournament: regisration, pairing, scoring, and statistics,
   right away through a simple web interface.  Project Leaguer also
   gives its users a unique option for scoring, not available through
   traditional tournament management techniques: peer review.  By
   providing a forward facing, web-based interface for tournament
   participants to score their teammates, Project Leaguer allows
   individual ability and activity to be recognized within the context
   of an all-in, win-or-lose multiplayer team game.
