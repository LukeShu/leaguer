Purpose:

The purpose of this document is to outlay the desgin, intent, and structure of
the Project Leaguer tournament organizing software.

Released under an open license, Project Leaguer leverages powerful web
technologies to provide everything needed to organize an online tournament.
Whether it's League of Legends, Chess, Poker, or more, Project Leaguer provides
tournament organizers, participants, and spectators with an online
interface to keep up with the score. Even better Project Leaguer offers scoring 
features and options which would be very difficult to implement with traditional 
tournament organizing practices such as peer review and team-independent 
individual scoring.

The software itself operates as a stand-alone background server application
accessible and configurable though its web interface which reveals to users a 
sleek web application which manages tournaments.
